# Intro

Hi, my name is Bálint Pataki, I am a hobby sportsman from Middle Europe - I live in a town called Sopron in Northwest Hungary and work in Vienna, Austria.
My Instagram: [Ödenburger Outdoor Stories](https://www.instagram.com/oedenburgeroutdoorstories/)

My goal with this blog is to track and share my (bigger) outdoor activities, preparations for such events and anything else related which come into my mind:)

My main sports are aikido (I know, that's far from an outdoor activity... but it is fun!), biking, hiking and trail running.

# Background
I have always been an active guy.
I was training very hard to be a footballer in my teenage years but then I decided to pursue university with engineering career and doing sports as a hobby only. That was the point when I started Aikido (in 2005) and since then, I am more or less continuously doing it.
I always loved being outdoors, biking or hiking. Later on, during university years in Sopron, Hungary, I got into trail running with friends.
The next decade (from around 2014 to 2023) was more or less about running and some calisthenics in terms of sports. I participated in half marathons, trail running events, ultramarathon relays and so on. 

# Turning Point
I am writing this article in early May, 2025.
During the last couple of years I was not sure where to go in sports. I did the black belt in Aikido in 2024 but in terms of outdoor activities... I was lost. I had no goal... and this is a dangerous place to be, especially if you are the kind of person who always had goals and have been motivated to reach them.
I rationalized how not to pursue new goals. I felt I reached what I wanted. I did the halfmarathon but had no motivation to do the marathon or ultra distances. I feel a bit ashamed of myself, because I was always an extremely energetic person and felt totally lost.

In August 2024 I bought a gravel bike, and it slowly changed everything. The first season was of course very short but as the next season started in 2025, something has started to whisper in my ears. "You need new goals. You need new goals and fight for them to feel more alive."
Every time I rode my new bike I felt totally free. The speed and the form gave me something new. I felt this is something new, something exciting. Something that I forgot how much I loved, but in a new form.

Then I lost my dad who was an idol for me in terms of sports. He was an iconic figure in friendly football matches even when he almost turned 80 and trained with more than 20 years younger men. He was a regional rowing champion and he loved sports. I always thought I have to follow his path and be active.

Then I participated in a multi-day hiking trip in Italy with like-minded people. 
Then I got sick and needed to rest a bit. 
That was the turning point when I decided to start my new journey.

I really needed a new goal. I was watching gravel videos and searching for new routes to ride nearby. I was planning riding trips with friends. 

Then I thought I need a big goal to prepare for and fight for.

I decided to participate in the [Hungarian Divide](https://klnd.eu/hungarian-divide-en/) (half distance) in 2026. Yes. This is the only ultra-cycling event in Hungary with more than 70% on trails, altogether it is around 700 kms.
This is a huge challenge. At least something to work towards!

Oh, and I almost forgot - I have another friend who is really huge inspiration for me in terms of sport nowadays: check his website and socials: [RunnerMate](https://runnermate.eu)! Thanks Mate, for organizing and keeping together such a nice [running group](https://duhajok.hu), although this was not my main focus during the last couple of months, but I appreciate it and whenever I come around, it is always super fun.

What else could I say?
I have to look forward and better be up for this challenge!

This metal song says exactly what I felt when I decided to get up and fight again:

<i>"Rain is pouring  
The wind is howling  
The skies are dark and dim  
Something's got a hold on you  
And drains you from within  
Tangled up  
In a world of sorrow  
You lost believe  
In a better tomorrow  
Don't surrender, stand your ground  
Time to turn around  </i>

<i>Burn down the bridges  
And leave it all behind  
Turn on the music  
Let it purify your mind  </i>

<i>Shout it out  
And play it loud  
Cause this is what it's all about  
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal never dies  
Heavy Metal never dies!"</i>
