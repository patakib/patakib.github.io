Hello Foreigner,

This is my first blog post as I had decided to participate in the half distance of the legendary [Hungarian Divide](https://klnd.eu/hungarian-divide-en/) ultra-cycling trail in 2026.

# Training Plan
I was never a big fan of too strict training plans when I prepared for half marathons or aikido belt exams. That hasn't changed:)
But I will need some planning of course. First of all, let's see where I begin.

## Experience
We have a great tradition with [one crazy friend of mine](https://www.instagram.com/hetenyi_daralo/), namely we do the round around Lake Balaton every year under 12 hours. This is not a trail, common road and it is around 210 km.
From time to time I ride 60-80 kms mostly on roads but I kind'a like the hills:)

I have experience in bikepacking, I did multiple trips in Hungary, these were mostly 3-5 days long with 80-100 km per day.

I like trail running, aikido and hiking - and I have decent cardiovascular strength based on the decade-long experience. But it won't be enough. :)

## Plan (some kind of)
I need to increase the amount of time on bike, no question about that, and I need to modify my weekly training schedule, which is mostly like this:
- 2-3 aikido trainings
- 1 running or cycling
- 1-2 strengthening (calisthenics)
- walking occasionally

I have to build up my cardiovascular strength again, perseverence, and experience with bikepacking and gravel biking - with focus on trails.

Thus, I want to dedicate the 2025 season for that. I want to do cycling at least 2 times a week - one longer (50+ km) and one shorter (20-30 km). This would be the bare minimum and occasionally some 100-200 km rides.
I will try to increase the percentage spent on trails and hills (this is not so difficult near Sopron at the Austrian border:)).

I have scheduled some biking events for this summer already (the Lake Balaton roundtrip, some others in Hungarian mountains as well).

By the end of this season, I want to achieve at least 3 multi-day trips on trails, from which at least one should be around 500 km long.

Besides that, as a cross-training, I will continue to do aikido and occasionally trail running.
And a LOT OF stretching and core training/mobility as I don't want to revitalize my low-back pain:).

## Summary

So, that's all - and that is something to work for.

I am on a journey again, finally.
The days and months (years) of comfortable sport is over. Not that I didn't need that, because you cannot always burn at the highest temperature. But I felt I needed a new spark and I found it.
