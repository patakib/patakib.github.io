Hi All,

On the 8th of June I participated in a gravel event, called "Vértes Ring". This is part of a series of such events in Hungary - you can check out this [website](https://ringsorozat.hu/).

# Venue
The tour took place in a wonderful mountain - ok, let's be honest, in Hungary there are no real mountains, but still.. -, called Vértes - which is part of Transdanubian mountains and it is not very far from Budapest (even more close to Tatabánya).

The start point was in Pusztavám (a small village) at the local forestry's forest school building and garden. It was a very nice place!

# Organization
The organization of the "Ring" events are usually very good. The participation is not so expensive and you get everything you need: food, refreshments during the tour, medal, and some discounts in the surrounding local shops, emergency and  medical treatment in case of serious problem.
The vibe is always good and there are generally a lot of nice people among the cyclists.

# How it went
So I registered for the longest distance, which was 88 km and around 30% in my experience was on trails (and further 20% at least on forestry roads with bad condition). That means you generally need at least a gravel bike, but a mountain bike or a trekking would be also fine, if you don't care about the speed. There were some guys with road bikes but even the organizer don't really recommend that.

I tend to use my Merida Cylex bike a lot during the season, normally I can't wait for the spring weather to be able to ride again, but I generally don't go for 100 km rides a lot. Usually I just go for 30-50 kms (of course, I participated a lot of longer rides but it is always a big occasion to me).
So I took it as a challenge because with almost 1500 m elevation and a lot of trails, it was, at least for me.

I finished below 4 hours, which is a very good result in my opinion. I averaged above 20 km/h, which I am proud of.

I could talk to some nice people after the event, it was just a very good vibe there. I can only recommend you this "Ring" series, if you like the trails.

All in all, it was a very nice tour and I am happy that I participated again. Let's go for the next one!:)

# Next Steps
As I am preparing for multi-day bikepacking tours, I know, that I need to elevate the distance of these rides. But first things first, I have to do it in small steps to avoid injuries and burnout, so in these 1-2 months I just concentrate on participating in such events more often, like every 2-3 weeks and having shorter rides in between just to collect more mileage.
After that, at the end of the summer or in autumn, my goal is to go for a multi-day ride.
